    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="Aleoids" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Extremely hardy photosynthetic organisms that thrive in arid environments. Thick, waxy leaf structures protect them from extreme surroundings. When gaseous exchange becomes unfavourable. the leaves can completely shut off the organism from the atmosphere causing a state of hibernation. The pointed leaves create precipitation slopes, which draw liquids to the heart of the organism. Here they are absorbed through a series of specialised cells, and stored in the root structure until needed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AsterPod" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These robust seed pods will drift through space for thousands of years before finding a suitable place to release their seeds and spores.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AsterTree" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These organic structures are not trees in the traditional sense, but long-lived and extremely hardy space-based organisms.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Bacterial" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>True unicellular extremophiles capable of living in the full spectrum of temperatures, chemical soups and atmospheres. They form a kaleidoscopic range of patterns and colours based on their method of metabolism. They derive energy from photosynthetic chemosynthetic or thermosynthetic processes. These are believed to be the precursors for many life forms, and are often found in conjunction with other species. Links between the biochemistry of bacterial colonies and neighbouring organisms are likely but as yet unproven.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Brancae" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These organic structures are so called because of the vaguely brain-like growths on the ends of their branches. These resilient organic structures absorb minerals via their subsurface roots and energy via their outer skin.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Cactoid" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Photosynthetic organisms that have adapted to extreme conditions by reducing their surface area to volume ratio, thereby protecting more sensitive tissues from exposure.The outer layer is formed from specialised light-transmitting cells. These are filled with an insulating hydrophobic layer, which helps to maintain core temperature and liquid retention. Deep, extensive root structures hold the organisms in place, and facilitate the extraction of trace minerals. Some cactoida species feature explosive seed distribution as a method of reproduction.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CalcitePlates" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These calcium-carbonate structures are created by vast numbers of tiny polyp-like creatures.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ChalicePod" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These robust seed pods are able to survive indefinitely in the vacuum of space.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Clypeus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Extremophile organisms that have evolved to create hard shield structures, primarily to protect against stellar radiation. They also collect and condense traces of liquid material in the atmosphere, allowing the organisms to flourish in extremely arid environments. The shields are typically synthesised from surrounding inorganic material. which will frequently define their shape and colouration.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CollaredPod" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These organisms absorb energy through their distinctive collar.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Conchas" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Highly specialised complex extremophiles that have developed protective and sturdy motile shell structures. These open and close based on the suitability of the current environmental conditions. The shells are an organic structure with an excreted inorganic insulated and sometimes reﬂective casing that help the organism maintain homeostasis. The internal organisms, which are remarkably tough in their own right, are only exposed for metabolic and reproductive purposes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Cone" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These organic structures survive by absorbing elements from nova and supernova, with the dense outer layer protecting them from the severest radiation.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Electricae" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Organisms found exclusively on extremely cold ice worlds in the vicinity of frozen lakes. The visible tips can be observed protruding from the ice, often near fissures where it is thinnest. The bulk of the organisms extend down through the ice into subsurface melt potentially for several kilometres. Electricae are superconductive in nature. utilising the thermal circulation of the surrounding fluid to drive an electrochemical process. This is probably why they are limited to planets with atmospheres dominated by noble gases. The surface structure exists to provide a connection to the atmosphere, which in turn creates a point of electrical potential difference. A by-product of this is the bioluminescent display that runs through the organism. Although never witnessed, reproduction presumably occurs below the surface by some unidentified process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Fonticulus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Photosynthetic colony organisms found exclusively on ice worlds, where they have embraced the surrounding frozen material as a form of protection. As the fonticulus develop they melt ice from around them, absorbing the liquid through tiny cellular pores and passing it to the colony’s reproductive edge. Here the liquid is excreted and immediately refreezes, creating hard translucent exoskeletons that provide protection for the organisms. Frond structures create a wide flat space that expose internal photosynthetic cells to as much light as possible. Reproduction appears to occur by colony division, most likely when a shard of the structure collapses under its own weight and the smaller shard creates a new colony.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Fumerolas" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Extremophile organisms located in regions with active fumaroles. Their metabolism is driven exclusively through chemosynthetic and thermosynthetic mechanisms based on nearby volcanic activity. Proximity to volcanic heat allows them to survive in environments where the ambient temperature is naturally too cold for them. They frequently incorporate minerals from the fumaroles’ ejecta, meaning they can appear inorganic at first glance and may sport exotic colours.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Fungoids" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Organisms that live deep inside a planetary substrate. They share similar morphology to fungi but are not saprophytic, instead their mycelial body drives its metabolism through chemosynthetic and thermosynthetic processes. These are facilitated by the substrate which also protects the organism from environmental extremes. The exposed aspects of the organisms are primarily involved in reproduction. This is frequently through spore ejection, but certain species also support gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. Some fungoicla exhibit bioluminescent behaviours as part of a metabolic process involved in the breakdown of accumulated toxins.</value>

  <data name="Osseus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Slow-growing organisms that can be found exclusively on rocky areas of planets. They are defined by a symbiotic relationship that has evolved between two unicellular organisms. which are now inseparable. One cell type is solely responsible for energy production by either photosynthetic. chemosynthetic or thermosynthetic processes. The symbiotic cells harvest some of this energy, and in turn deposit a hard rock-like substance extracted from the local geology to create a rigid endoskeleton. This structure provides a solid base for the organism to exist. It features complex folds that help increase available surface area for metabolic interactions. Osseus have been observed to create callus-like cell coverings, and withdraw themselves into the endoskeleton for protection.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Recepta" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Extremophiles that are found exclusively on planets wlth atmospheres dominated by sulphur dioxide. Using a combination of inorganic and hydrocarbon materials, they build a shielding bubble. This allows them to create an isolated biome with regulated temperature and chemical composition. Growth is a difﬁcult and complex process that requires careful melting, regrowing and freezing of the external shell so that the internal organism can develop. This is a gradual process meaning that larger recepta are of significant age. Reproduction is also similarly complex and revolves around a budding process, which creates a smaller version of the adult. Once detached, it can roll under the action of gravity and air currents before coming to rest, where it will deploy a holdfast marking its final position.</value>

    <value>Low-lying photosynthetic organisms that bond tightly to the surface of rocks. The body of the organism may be embedded in the rock subsurface to provide protection from the elements, leaving the tough photosynthetic proto-leaves exposed. Their simple proto-evolutionary nature means that they are a common sight on rocky worlds. Colouration is driven by a mixture of the mineral content of the attached rock and the absorption spectral of the nearby stellar body.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Tubus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Highly specialised organisms that can grow to extreme heights, which peak when in a mature state. The organisms’ height and ability to survive is largely constrained by gravity. The lack of any real atmospheric weather has not put evolutionaly pressure on the towers to be strong, so they form tall but thin structures which cannot be supported in high-gravity environments. The tower is formed from wrapped leaf-like structures, which create a regulated chimney void. This is used by the organism to create and maintain an artificial internal atmosphere, where discrete chemical processes can be undertaken along the length of the tower. Waste gases and other material may he released from the top of the tower. Some species feature external rings that can be used to gauge an organism’s age.</value>

  <data name="Tussocks" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Robust photosynthetic plants similar in appearance to clump grasses. They have a shallow but complex root structure, which requires a solid surface to produce structural stability.
