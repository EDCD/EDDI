# Templating with EDDI

EDDI's speech responder uses Cottle for templating.  Cottle has a number of great features, including:

    * Ability to set and update variables, including arrays
    * Loops
    * Conditionals
    * Subroutines

Information on how to write Cottle templates is available at https://cottle.readthedocs.io/, and EDDI's default templates use a lot of the functions available.

## State Variables

Cottle does not retain state between templates, but EDDI provides a way of doing this with state variables.  State variables are provided to each Cottle template, and templates can set state variables that will be made available in future templates.

State variables are available for individual templates in the 'state' object.  Note that state variables are not persistent, and the state is empty whenever EDDI restarts.  Also, because EDDI responders run asynchronously and concurrently there is no guarantee that, for example, the speech responder for an event will finish before the VoiceAttack responder for an event starts (or vice versa).

## Context

EDDI uses the idea of context to attempt to keep track of what it is talking about.  This can enhance the experience when used with VoiceAttack by allowing repetition and more detailed information to be provided.

## EDDI Functions

In addition to the basic Cottle features EDDI has a number of features that provide added functionality and specific information for Elite: Dangerous.  Details of these functions are as follows:

### BlueprintDetails()

This function will provide full information for a blueprint, given its name and grade.

BlueprintDetails() takes two mandatory arguments: the name of the blueprint and the grade to retrieve. 

Common usage of this is to provide further information about a blueprint, for example:

    {set blueprint to BlueprintDetails("Dirty Drive Tuning", 5)}
    {len(blueprint.materials)} {if len(blueprint.materials) > 1: different materials are |else: material is} required to produce {blueprint.localizedName}.

### BodyDetails()

This function will provide full information for a body given its name.

BodyDetails() takes a single mandatory argument of the name of the body for which you want more information.  If the body is not in the current system then it can be provided with a second parameter of the name of the system.

Common usage of this is to provide further information about a body, for example:

    {set body to BodyDetails("Earth", "Sol")}
    Earth is {body.distancefromstar} light years from the system's main star.

### CargoDetails()

This function will provide full information for a cargo, carried in the commander's hold.

CargoDetails() takes one mandatory argument, of two possible forms. 
- The first form, a commodity name of the cargo. If the commodity is not in the hold, a 'null' is returned.
- The second form, a mission ID associated with the cargo, as haulage. If the mission ID is not associated with haulage, a 'null' is returned.

Common usage of this is to provide further information about a particular cargo, for example:

    {set cargo to CargoDetails("Tea")}
    {if cargo && cargo.total > 0: You have {cargo.total} tonne{if cargo.total != 1: s} of {cargo.name} in your cargo hold.}

or for a mission-related event,

    {set cargo to CargoDetails(event.missionid)}
    {if cargo: {cargo.total} tonne{if cargo.total != 1: s} of {cargo.name} is in your hold for this mission.}

### CombatRatingDetails()

This function will provide full information for a combat rating given its name.

CombatRatingDetails() takes a single argument of the combat rating for which you want more information.

Common usage of this is to provide further information about your rating, for example:

    You have been promoted {CombatRatingDetails("Expert").rank} times.

### CommanderName()

This function will provide the name of your commander.

If you have set up a phonetic name for your commander it will return that, otherwise if your commander name has been set it will return that. The phonetic name uses SSML tags.

### CommodityMarketDetails()

This function will provide full information for a commodity, including information that is specific to a market, given the commodity name.

CommodityMarketDetails() takes one mandatory argument and two optional arguments. 
- The first argument, the name of the commodity for which you want more information, is mandatory.
- The second argument, the name of the station to reference for market data, is optional. If not given then EDDI will default to the current station (if the current station is not set and no station is specified then this shall return empty). 
- The third argument, the name of the system to reference for market data, is optional. If not given then EDDI will default to the current star system (if the specified station cannot be found within the current star system then EDDI shall return empty).

Common usage of this is to provide further information about a commodity, for example:

    {set marketcommodity to CommodityMarketDetails("Pesticides", "Chelbin Service Station", "Wolf 397")}
    {marketcommodity.name} is selling for {marketcommodity.sellprice} with a current market demand of {marketcommodity.demand} units.

### Distance()

This function will provide the distance (in light years) between two systems.

Distance() takes either two or six arguments.
- Two argurments, the names of the two systems.
- Six arguments, the x, y, z coordinates of the two systems.

Examples of each usage:

    {set distance to Distance("Sol", "Betelgeuse")}
    {set distance to Distance(from.x, from.y, from.z, to.x, to.y, to.z)}

### EconomyDetails()

This function will provide full information for an economy given its name.

EconomyDetails() takes a single argument of the economy for which you want more information.

At current this does not have a lot of use as the economy object only contains its name, but expect it to be expanded in future.

### Emphasize()

This function allows you to give emphasis to specific words (to the extent supported by the voice you are using - your mileage may vary). This function uses SSML tags.

Emphasize() takes one mandatory argument: the text to speak with emphasis. If no secondary argument is specified, it shall default to a strong emphasis.
Emphasize() also takes one optional argument: the degreee of emphasis to place on the text (legal values for the degree of emphasis include "strong", "moderate", "none" and "reduced").

Common usage of this is to provide a more human-sounding reading of text by allowing the application of emphasis:

   That is a {Emphasize('beautiful', 'strong')} ship you have there.

### EmpireRatingDetails()

This function will provide full information for an empire rating given its name.

EmpireRatingDetails() takes a single argument of the empire rating for which you want more information.

F() takes a single parameter that is the name of the script to invoke.

One example of its use is in the script for the event `Trade Promotion`:

    You have been recognised for your trading ability, {F("Honorific")}.

Here the call to script `Honorific` will generate the right title for the player, according to their allegiance.

### FactionDetails()

This function will provide full information for a minor faction given its name.

FactionDetails() typically takes a single argument of the faction name, but may add a system name for filtering.

Common usage of this is to obtain a `Faction` object, providing current specifics of a minor faction, for example:

    {set faction to FactionDetails("Lavigny's Legion")}
    {if faction.name != "":
        {faction.name} is present in the
        {for presence in faction.presences:
            {presence.systemName},
        }
        {if len(faction.presences) = 1: system |else: systems}.
    }

### HaulageDetails()

This function will provide 'haulage' information for a mission-related cargo. See the 'haulage' object for variable details.

HaulageDetails() takes one mandatory argument, a mission ID associated with the haulage. If the mission ID is not associated with haulage, a 'null' is returned.

Common usage of this is to provide further information about a particular mission haulage, for example:

	{set haulage to HaulageDetails(event.missionid)}
    {if haulage && haulage.deleivered > 0:
        {set total to haulage.amount + haulage.deleivered}
	    {haulage.type} mission to the cargo depot is {round(haulage.delivered / total * 100, 0)} percent complete.
    }

### Humanise()

This function will turn its argument into a more human number, for example turning 31245 in to "just over thirty thousand".

Humanise() takes one argument: the number to humanise.

Common usage of this is to provide human-sounding numbers when speaking rather than saying every digit, for example:

   You have {Humanise(cmdr.credits)} credits.

### ICAO()

This function will turn its argument into an ICAO spoken value, for example "NCC" becomes "November Charlie Charlie".

ICAO() takes one argument: the value to turn in to ICAO.

Common usage of this is to provide clear callsigns and idents for ships, for example:

   Ship ident is {ICAO(ship.ident)}.

### InaraDetails()

This function will provide records from https://inara.cz for commanders with profiles on that website. Some values may be missing, depending on the completeness of the records and on the commander's sharing settings on https://inara.cz.

InaraDetails() takes one argument: the name of the commander to look up on Inara.cz.

Common usage of this is to provide details about other commanders. See the 'inaracmdr' object for variable details.

This function will provide jump information based on your ship loadout and current fuel level, dependent on the following types:

  * `next` range of next jump at current fuel mass and current laden mass
  * `max` maximum jump range at minimum fuel mass and current laden mass
  * `total` total range of multiple jumps from current fuel mass and current laden mass
  * `full` total range of multiple jumps from maximum fuel mass and current laden mass

  The returned `JumpDetail` object contains properties `distance` and `jumps`.

 Common usage is to provide distance and number of jumps for a specific query:

    {set detail to JumpDetails("total")}
    Total jump range at current fuel levels is {round(detail.distance, 1)} light years with {detail.jumps} jumps until empty.
    {if detail.distance < destdistance:
	    Warning: Fuel levels insufficient to reach destination. Fuel scooping is required.
	}

### List()

This function will return a humanised list of items from an array (e.g. this, that, and the other thing).

List() takes a single argument, the array variable with items you want listed.

Common usage is to convert an array to a list, for example:

    {set systemsrepaired to ['the hull', 'the cockpit', 'corroded systems']}

    Iron is a {MaterialDetails("Iron").rarity.name} material.

The second argument, the name of a star system, is optional. If provided then the `bodyname` and `bodyshortname` properties in the resulting `Material` object will return details from body with the highest concentration of the material within the specified star system.

Common usage of this is to provide recommendations for material gathering.

    {set materialName to "Iron"}
    {set details to MaterialDetails(materialName, system.name)}
    The best place to find {materialName} in {system.name} is on {if details.bodyname != details.bodyshortname: body} {details.bodyshortname}.

### MissionDetails()

This function will provide full information for a mission given its mission ID.

MissionDetails() takes a single argument of the mission ID for which you want more information.

Common usage of this is to provide detailed information about a previously accepted mission, for example:

### TrafficDetails()

This function will provide information on traffic and hostilities in a star system.

TrafficDetails() takes one mandatory argument and one optional argument.

The first mandatory argument is the name of the star system. The second optional argument defines different data sets that are available:

  * `traffic` the number of ships that have passed through the star system (this is the default if no second argument is provided)
  * `deaths` the number of ships passing through the star system which have been destroyed
  * `hostility` the percent of ships passing through the star system which have been destroyed

  The returned `Traffic` object contains properties representing various timespans: `day`, `week` and `total`.

Common usage is to provide information about traffic and hostilities within a star system, for example:

    {set trafficDetails to TrafficDetails(system.name)}
    {if trafficDetails.day > 0: At least {trafficDetails.day} ships have passed through {system.name} today. }

    {set deathDetails to TrafficDetails(system.name, "deaths")}
    {if deathDetails.week > 0: At least {deathDetails.week} ships have been destroyed in {system.name} this week. }

### OneOf()

This function will take one of the arguments available to it, picking randomly.

OneOf() takes as many arguments are you want to give it.

Common usage of this is to provide variation to spoken text, for example:

    You have {OneOf("docked", "finished docking", "completed docking procedures")}.

### Occasionally()

This function will take its argument 1/*n*th of the time, the rest of time discarding it.

Occasionally() takes two arguments: n, and the text argument.

Common usage of this is to provide additional text that is said now and again but would become irritating if said all the time, for example:

   Boost engaged.  {Occasionally(7, "Hold on to something.")}

Note that Occasionally() works on random numbers rather than counters, so in the above example the additional text will not show up every 7th time you boost but will show up on average 1/7 of the times that you boost.

### P()

This function will attempt to provide phonetic pronunciation for the supplied text. This function uses SSML tags.

P() takes a single argument of the string for which to alter the pronunciation.

Common usage of this is to wrap the names of planets, powers, ships etc., for example:

    You are in the {P(system.name)} system.

### Pause()

This function will pause the speech for a given amount of time. This function uses SSML tags.

Pause() takes one argument: the number of milliseconds to pause.

Common usage of this is to allow speech to sync up with in-game sounds, for example to wait for a known response to a phrase before continuing, for example:

    Hello.  {Pause(2000)} Yes.

### Play()

This function will play an audio file as supplied in the argument. This function uses SSML tags.

Play() takes one argument: the path to the file to play.  This file must be a '.wav' file.  Any backslashes for path separators must be escaped, so '\\' must be written as '\\\\'

Common usage of this is to provide a pre-recorded custom audio file rather than use EDDI's text-to-speech, for example:

    {Play('C:\\Users\\CmdrMcDonald\\Desktop\\Warning.wav')}

### RouteDetails()

This function will produce a destination/route for valid mission destinations.

RouteDetails takes one mandatory argument, the `routetype`, and up to two optional arguments.

  * `nearest` Mission destination nearest to your current location.
  * `next` Next destination in the currently stored route.
  * `raw` Nearest raw materials trader.
  * `route` 'Traveling Salesman' (RNNA) route for all active missions. Takes a system name as an optional secondary argument. If set, the resulting route shall be plotted relative to the specified star system rather than relative to the current star system.
  * `scoop` Nearest scoopable star system.
  * `set` Set destination route to a single system. Sets the route destination to the last star system name returned from a `Route details` event. An optional second argument sets the route destination to the star system name specified instead. An optional third argument sets the destination station.
  * `source` Destination to nearest mission 'cargo source'. Takes a system name as an optional secondary argument. If set, the resulting route shall be plotted relative to the specified star system rather than relative to the current star system. 
  * `update` Update to the next mission route destination, once all missions in current system are completed. Takes a system name as an optional secondary argument. If set, the resulting route shall be plotted relative to the specified star system rather than relative to the current star system.
    
Common usage of this is to provide destination/route details, dependent on the 'routetype', for example:

    {RouteDetails("cancel")}
    {RouteDetails("set", "Achenar", "Macmillan Terminal")}
    {set system to RouteDetails("nearest")}
    {set system to RouteDetails("most", "Sol")}

Upon success of the query, a 'Route details' event is triggered, providing a following event data:

This function will set a session state value.  The value will be available as a property of the 'state' object in future templates within the same EDDI session.

SetState takes two arguments: the name of the state value to set, and its value.  The name of the state value will be converted to lower-case and spaces changed to underscores.  The value must be either a boolean, a number, or a string; other values will be ignored.

Common usage of this is to keep track of the cumulative or persistent information within a session, for example:

    {SetState("distance_travelled_today", state.distance_travelled_today + event.distance)}

### ShipCallsign()

This function will provide your ship's callsign in the same way that Elite provides it (i.e. manufacturer followed by first three letters of your commander name).
