    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    You are in the {P(system.name, "starsystem")} system.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Pause" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This function will pause the speech for a given amount of time. This function uses SSML tags.

Pause() takes one argument: the number of milliseconds to pause.

    Hello.  {Pause(2000)} Yes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Play" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This function will play an audio file as supplied in the argument. This function uses SSML tags.

Play() takes one mandatory argument: the path to the file to play.  Various common Windows file formats are supported.  Any backslashes for path separators must be escaped, so '\\' must be written as '\\\\'

Play() also takes two optional arguments. The first optional argument is a boolean value which if true will play the audio file asynchronously. The second optional argument is a number representing the volume of the audio, where 100 is normal volume.

Common usage of this is to provide a pre-recorded custom audio file rather than use EDDI's text-to-speech, for example:

    {Play('C:\\Users\\CmdrMcDonald\\Desktop\\Warning.wav', false, 125)}</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RefreshProfile" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This function will refresh the Frontier API profile.

* `raw` Nearest raw materials trader.
* `route` 'Traveling Salesman' (RNNA) route for all active missions. Takes a system name as an optional secondary argument. If set, the resulting route shall be plotted relative to the specified star system rather than relative to the current star system.
* `scoop` Nearest scoopable star system.
* `set` Set destination route to a single system. Sets the route destination to the last star system name returned from a `Route details` event. An optional second argument sets the route destination to the star system name specified instead. An optional third argument sets the destination station.
* `source` Destination to nearest mission 'cargo source'. Takes a system name as an optional secondary argument. If set, the resulting route shall be plotted relative to the specified star system rather than relative to the current star system. 
* `update` Update to the next mission route destination, once all missions in current system are completed. Takes a system name as an optional secondary argument. If set, the resulting route shall be plotted relative to the specified star system rather than relative to the current star system.

Common usage of this is to provide destination/route details, dependent on the 'routetype', for example:

    {RouteDetails("cancel")}
    {RouteDetails("set", "Achenar", "Macmillan Terminal")}

    <value># Templating with EDDI

EDDI's speech responder uses Cottle for templating.  Cottle has a number of great features, including:

* Ability to set and update variables, including arrays
* Loops
* Conditionals
* Subroutines

Information on how to write Cottle templates is available at https://cottle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/, and EDDI's default templates use a lot of the functions available.

## State Variables

Cottle does not retain state between templates, but EDDI provides a way of doing this with state variables.  State variables are provided to each Cottle template, and templates can set state variables that will be made available in future templates.

State variables are available for individual templates in the 'state' object.  Note that state variables are not persistent, and the state is empty whenever EDDI restarts.  Also, because EDDI responders run asynchronously and concurrently there is no guarantee that, for example, the speech responder for an event will finish before the VoiceAttack responder for an event starts (or vice versa).

## Context

EDDI uses the idea of context to attempt to keep track of what it is talking about.  This can enhance the experience when used with VoiceAttack by allowing repetition and more detailed information to be provided.

## EDDI Functions

In addition to the basic Cottle features EDDI has a number of features that provide added functionality and specific information for Elite: Dangerous.  Details of these functions are as follows:</value>
