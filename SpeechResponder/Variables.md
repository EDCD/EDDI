# EDDI Variables

EDDI provides many variables that can be used to help provide immersive scripts and more interesting.  Most variables are held as objects that are exposed from EDDI.  Access to the property of the object is using a period, for example `cmdr.name` would obtain the `name` value from the `cmdr` object.

EDDI can also have event-specific variables in the `event` object.  These usually come from external sources and so are not part of the standard objects, although they might reference them.

Details of the objects available are as follows:
