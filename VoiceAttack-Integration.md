EDDI integrates with VoiceAttack in two ways.  Firstly, it generates a large number of variables inside VoiceAttack and keeps them up-to-date.  Secondly, it runs VoiceAttack commands when events occur.

# Using EDDI with VoiceAttack

N.B. EDDI requires at least version 1.6.0 of VoiceAttack to function correctly.

For EDDI to work with VoiceAttack it must be installed as a VoiceAttack plugin.  To do this EDDI should be installed within the `Apps` directory of your VoiceAttack installation; by default VoiceAttack installs in one of two locations: 
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\VoiceAttack` (for standard licenses)
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\VoiceAttack` (for Steam licenses)

VoiceAttack must be configured to use plugins.  To do so you must click on the Settings icon (a spanner) in the top-right corner of the VoiceAttack and check the 'Enable plugin support' option and restart VoiceAttack.

If EDDI is installed in the correct location and plugin support is enabled you should see a message when starting VoiceAttack along the lines of `Plugin EDDI 3.7.1 initialized`.

## EDDI's VoiceAttack Profile

EDDI provides a VoiceAttack profile with some basic commands.  This is not a control profile, in that it does not provide you with the ability to control the ship, it does allow the user to interact with EDDI with phrases such as "please could you repeat that" and questions such as "what use is decoded emission data?"  It also allows you to bring up EDDI's configuration UI with the "Configure EDDI" command.

The profile is available in the EDDI installation directory as EDDI.vap.

**_Disclaimer: We recommend that users check the terms and conditions of third party licensing agreements prior to linking or using EDDI's VoiceAttack profile with any licensed third party product. We shall not be held responsible for any third party licensing claims that arise from breaches of third party licensing agreements._**

# Running Commands on EDDI Events

Whenever EDDI sees a particular event occur it will attempt to run a script.  The name of the script depends on the event, but follows the form:

    ((EDDI <event>))

with the \<event\> being in lower-case.  For example, if you wanted VoiceAttack to run a script every time you docked you would create a script called `((EDDI docked))` (note the lower-case d at the beginning of docked).

There are a large number of events available.  Full details of the variables available for each event are available in the individual [event pages](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDI/wiki/Events).  Note that event variables are only valid when the event occurs, and cannot be relied upon to be present or a specific value at any other time.  If you want to use information in an event after the event itself then you should copy the value to another variable.

# EDDI Plugin Functions

EDDI's VoiceAttack plugin allows you to access its features in your own profile.  Details of these functions are laid out below.

Note: Though the examples in this section show variables being passed as parameters within the plugin interface, it is no longer necessary to do so. Rather, when the plugin is invoked then the plugin will search for variables matching the plugin context and set prior to invoking the plugin.

## Speech functions

### say

This function uses EDDI's voice to read a script. It takes one mandatory and two optional variables as parameters.

- 'Script' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the script to be read. 
- 'Priority' (integer variable) is an optional parameter defining the priority of the invoked speech (defaults to 3).
- 'Voice' (text variable) is an optional parameter defining the name of the voice you want to use.  Note that when you set this variable it will continue to be used until you unset it, at which point EDDI will use the voice configured in its text-to-speech settings.

For convenience, the value `$=` in the script stands for the phonetic name of your ship while the value `$-` stands for your commander's phonetic name.

To use this function in your own commands set the 'Script' variable and optionally the 'Priority' and 'Voice' variables, then use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'say'.

### speech

## Information functions

### coriolis, edshipyard, eddbsystem, or eddbstation

Looks up the current ship, the current starsystem, or the current station (as applicable). A web uri is written to '\{TXT: EDDI uri\}' and, unless '\{BOOL:EDDI open uri in browser\}' has been set to false, the uri is opened in the default browser.

### inara

Looks up a named commander on the website Inara.cz. It takes one mandatory variable as a parameter.

- 'Name' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the name of the commander to look up on Inara.cz.

A web uri is written to '\{TXT: EDDI uri\}' and, unless '\{BOOL:EDDI open uri in browser\}' has been set to false, the uri is opened in the default browser.

To use this function in your own commands set the 'Name' parameter then use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'inara'.

### jumpdetails

This function will provide jump information based on your ship loadout and current fuel level. It takes one mandatory variable as a parameter.

- 'Type variable' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the type of the information to return.

  * `next` range of next jump at current fuel mass and current laden mass
  * `max` maximum jump range at minimum fuel mass and current laden mass
  * `total` total range of multiple jumps from current fuel mass and current laden mass
  * `full` total range of multiple jumps from maximum fuel mass and current laden mass

When this function is used, the following variables will be updated and made available for use in VoiceAttack:

- \{DEC:Ship jump detail distance\}
- \{INT:Ship jump detail jumps\}

To use this function in your own commands set the 'Type variable' parameter then use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'jumpdetails'.

### route

This function will produce a destination/route for valid mission destinations. It takes one mandatory and up to two optional variables as parameters.

- 'Type variable' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the type of update to execute.

  * `cancel` Cancel the currently stored route.
  * `encoded` Nearest encoded materials trader.
  * `expiring` Destination of your next expiring mission.
  * `facilitator` Nearest 'Legal Facilities' contact.
  * `farthest` Mission destination farthest from your current location.
  * `guardian` Nearest guardian technology broker.
  * `human` Nearest human technology broker.

  * `set` Set destination route to the last star system name returned from a `Route details` event. 
  * `source` Destination to nearest mission 'cargo source'.
  * `update` Update to the next mission route destination (use this once all missions in the current system are completed).

- 'System variable' (text variable) is an optional parameter for the following route update types. 

  * `most` If set, the resulting route shall be plotted relative to the specified star system rather than relative to the current star system.
  * `route` If set, the resulting route shall be plotted relative to the specified star system rather than relative to the current star system.
  * `set` If set, the resulting route shall proceed directly to the specified single star system rather than to the last star system identified in a route search.
  * `source` If set, the resulting route shall be plotted relative to the specified star system rather than relative to the current star system.
  * `update` If set, the specified star system shall be removed from the route rather than removing the prior mission route destination.

- 'Station variable' (text variable) is an optional parameter for the following route update types

  * `set` If set, the resulting route shall proceed directly to the specified single star system and station rather than to the last star system and station identified in a route search.

To use this function in your own commands set the 'Type variable' parameter and when appropriate the `System variable` and 'Station variable' parameters then use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'route'. Upon success, a '((EDDI route details))' event is triggered, providing event data as described [in the appropriate wiki page](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDI/wiki/Route-details-event).

Upon success of the query, a 'Route details' event is triggered with details from the destination and route.

## Utility functions

### setstate

This function pushes a state variable to EDDI's internal session state, allowing it to be shared with other responders. It takes two mandatory variables as parameters.

- 'State variable' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the name of the VoiceAttack variable to store in EDDI.
- The variable to store in EDDI (integer, boolean, decimal, or text variable), as referenced by the 'State variable' parameter.

To use this function in your own commands set the variables described above then use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'setstate'. This function will read the text variable 'State variable' and store the VoiceAttack variable named in there as a state variable.  

For example, if you wanted to store the VoiceAttack boolean variable "Verbose" as a state variable you would:

    * set the boolean variable "Verbose" to the desired value
    * set the text variable "State variable" to "Verbose"
    * call EDDI with the context set to "setstate"

![](images/VoiceAttack-PluginView-SetState.jpg)

This function only supports integers, booleans, decimals and strings as state values.  The name of the value will be altered if necessary to ensure that it is all lower-case, and that spaces are replace by underscores.  For example, if you attempt to store a state variable "My variable" it will be stored as "my_variable".

State variables are made available in VoiceAttack with the prefix 'EDDI state'.  For example, to access the text variable stored in the last paragraph you would use '\{TXT:EDDI state my_variable\}'.

To access the same variable from within EDDI's Speech Responder, you would call '\{state.my_variable\}'.

Please note that state is transient, and is purposefully not persisted beyond the running instance of EDDI.  This means that every time you start VoiceAttack the state will be empty.  Also, because EDDI responders run asynchronously and concurrently there is no guarantee that, for example, the speech responder for an event will finish before the VoiceAttack responder for an event starts (or vice versa).
