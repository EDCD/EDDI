EDDI integrates with VoiceAttack in two ways.  Firstly, it generates a large number of variables inside VoiceAttack and keeps them up-to-date.  Secondly, it runs VoiceAttack commands when events occur.

# Using EDDI with VoiceAttack

N.B. EDDI requires at least version 1.6.0 of VoiceAttack to function correctly.

For EDDI to work with VoiceAttack it must be installed as a VoiceAttack plugin.  To do this EDDI should be installed within the `Apps` directory of your VoiceAttack installation; by default VoiceAttack installs in `C:\Program Files (x86)\VoiceAttack`.

VoiceAttack must be configured to use plugins.  To do so you must click on the Settings icon (a spanner) in the top-right corner of the VoiceAttack and check the 'Enable plugin support' option and restart VoiceAttack.

If EDDI is installed in the correct location and plugin support is enabled you should see a message when starting VoiceAttack along the lines of `Plugin EDDI 3.4.1 initialized`.

## EDDI's VoiceAttack Profile

EDDI provides a VoiceAttack profile with some basic commands.  This is not a control profile, in that it does not provide you with the ability to control the ship, it does allow the user to interact with EDDI with phrases such as "please could you repeat that" and questions such as "what use is decoded emission data?"  It also allows you to bring up EDDI's configuration UI with the "Configure EDDI" command.

The profile is available in the EDDI installation directory as EDDI.vap.

# Running Commands on EDDI Events

Whenever EDDI sees a particular event occur it will attempt to run a script.  The name of the script depends on the event, but follows the form:

    ((EDDI <event>))

with the <event> being in lower-case.  For example, if you wanted VoiceAttack to run a script every time you docked you would create a script called `((EDDI docked))` (note the lower-case d at the beginning of docked).

There are a large number of events available.  Full details of the variables available for each event are available in the individual [event pages](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDI/wiki/Events).  Note that event variables are only valid when the event occurs, and cannot be relied upon to be present or a specific value at any other time.  If you want to use information in an event after the event itself then you should copy the value to another variable.

# EDDI Plugin Functions

EDDI's VoiceAttack plugin allows you to access its features in your own profile.  Details of these functions are laid out below.

![](../images/VoiceAttack-PluginView.jpg)

## say

This function uses EDDI's voice to read a script. It takes one mandatory and two optional parameters.
- 'Script' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the script to be read. 
- 'Priority' (integer variable) is an optional parameter defining the priority of the invoked speech (defaults to 3).
- 'Voice' (text variable) is an optional parameter defining the name of the voice you want to use.  Note that when you set this variable it will continue to be used until you unset it, at which point EDDI will use the voice configured in its text-to-speech settings.

To use this function in your own commands use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'say' and passing the parameters described above.

## speech

This function uses EDDI's voice to read a Speech Responder script. It takes one mandatory and two optional parameters.
- 'Script' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the name of the script to invoke. 
- 'Priority' (integer variable) is an optional parameter defining the priority of the invoked speech (defaults to 3).
- 'Voice' (text variable) is an optional parameter defining the name of the voice you want to use.  Note that when you set this variable it will continue to be used until you unset it, at which point EDDI will use the voice configured in its text-to-speech settings.
 
To use this function in your own commands use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'say' and passing the parameters described above.

## shutup

This function stops any active EDDI speech. There are no parameters.

To use this function in your own commands use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'shutup'.

## disablespeechresponder

This function tells the speech responder to not talk unless specifically asked for information. There are no parameters. This lasts until either VoiceAttack is restarted or an enablespeechresponder call is made.

To use this function in your own commands use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'disablespeechresponder'.

## enablespeechresponder

This function tells the speech responder to respond normally to events. There are no parameters.

To use this function in your own commands use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'enablespeechresponder'.

## setspeechresponderpersonality

This function changes the speech responder's personality. It takes one mandatory parameter.
- 'Personality' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the name of the personality to invoke.

Note that unlike enablespeechresponder and disablespeechresponder any changes made here are persistent.

To use this function in your own commands use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'setspeechresponderpersonality' and passing the 'Personality' parameter.

## setstate

This function pushes a state variable to EDDI's internal session state, allowing it to be shared with other responders. It takes two mandatory parameters.
- 'State variable' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the name of the VoiceAttack variable to store in EDDI.
- The variable to store in EDDI (integer, boolean, decimal, or text variable), as referenced by the 'State variable' parameter.

To use this function in your own commands use the 'Execute an external plugin function' command with the plugin context set to 'setstate' and passing the parameters described above. This function will read the text variable 'State variable' and store the VoiceAttack variable named in there as a state variable.  

For example, if you wanted to store the VoiceAttack boolean variable "Verbose" as a state variable you would:

    * set the boolean variable "Verbose" to the desired value
    * set the text variable "State variable" to "Verbose"
    * call EDDI with the context set to "setstate" and passing the text variable parameter "State variable"

![](../images/VoiceAttack-PluginView-SetState.jpg)

This function only supports integers, booleans, decimals and strings as state values.  The name of the value will be altered if necessary to ensure that it is all lower-case, and that spaces are replace by underscores.  For example, if you attempt to store a state variable "My variable" it will be stored as "my_variable".

State variables are made available in VoiceAttack with the prefix 'EDDI state'.  For example, to access the text variable stored in the last paragraph you would use '\{TXT:EDDI state my_variable\}'.

To access the same variable from within EDDI's Speech Responder, you would call '\{state.my_variable\}'.

Please note that state is transient, and is purposefully not persisted beyond the running instance of EDDI.  This means that every time you start VoiceAttack the state will be empty.  Also, because EDDI responders run asynchronously and concurrently there is no guarantee that, for example, the speech responder for an event will finish before the VoiceAttack responder for an event starts (or vice versa).

## coriolis, edshipyard, eddbsystem, or eddbstation
Looks up the current ship, the current starsystem, or the current station (as applicable). A web uri is written to {TXT: EDDI uri} and, unless {BOOL:EDDI open uri in browser} has been set to false, the uri is opened in the default browser.

## inara
Looks up a named commander on the website Inara.cz. It takes one mandatory parameter.
- 'Name' (text variable) is a mandatory parameter containing the name of the commander to look up on Inara.cz.

A web uri is written to {TXT: EDDI uri} and, unless {BOOL:EDDI open uri in browser} has been set to false, the uri is opened in the default browser.
